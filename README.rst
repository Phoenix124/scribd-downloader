**Some information about Scribd documents:**

There are two types of documents on Scribd:

-  Documents made up using a collection of images and
-  Actual documents where the text can be selected, copied etc.

This script takes a different approach to both of them:

-  Documents consisting of a collection of images is straightforward and
   this script will simply download the induvidual images which can
   be combined to ``.pdf`` by passing ``--pdf`` option to the tool. Simple.

-  Actual documents where the text can be selected are hard to tackle.
   If we feed such a document to this tool, only the text present in
   document will be downloaded. Scribd seems to use javascript to somehow
   combine text and images. So far, I haven't been able to combine them
   with Python in a way they look like the original document.

Examples
--------

Scribd Documents
----------------
Downloading text from document containing selectable text:
::
   $ scribdl https://www.scribd.com/document/55949937/33-Strategies-of-War

(Text will be saved side by side in a ``.md`` file in the current
working directory)

Download document containing images; use the ``--images`` option (the tool cannot figure out this on its own):
::
    $ scribdl -i https://scribd.com/doc/17142797/Case-in-Point

(Images will be saved in the current working directory)

Scribd Books
------------
The below command will generate an ``.md`` file of the book in the current working directory:
::
    $ scribdl https://www.scribd.com/read/189087235/Confessions-of-a-Casting-Director-Help-Actors-Land-Any-Role-with-Secrets-from-Inside-the-Audition-Room

Pass ``--pdf`` option to convert the generated output to a PDF.

This will only dowload the book content available without owning a premium account on Scribd.
See the below section for downloading full books if you own a premium Scribd account.

Scribd Audiobooks
-----------------
This will download .mp3 of the audiobook:
::
   $ scribdl https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/237606860/100-Ways-to-Motivate-Yourself-Change-Your-Life-Forever
   
This will only download the preview version of the audiobook. See the below section for
downloading complete audiobooks if you own a premium Scribd account.

-------------------------------------------------
Downloading complete textual books and audiobooks
-------------------------------------------------

If you have a premium Scribd account, you can also download the full version of
textual books and audiobooks.

Create a text file containing your Scribd credentials, such that the contents of the file look like below:
::
    user@mail.com
    password


Now pass the file path to the ``-c`` option, for example:
::
    $ scribdl -c scribd_credentials.txt https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/359295794/Principles-Life-and-Work

It should then download you all the audiobook chapters as mp3. Similarly, you could also download complete
contents of a Scribd book by replacing the URL with the URL of your choice.

If you're not willing to use place your account credentials in a file, you could also copy the cookie values
for ``_scribd_session`` and ``_scribd_expire`` when logged into your premium account on scribd on the web
browser and replace them with the ones in this file https://github.com/ritiek/scribd-downloader/blob/master/scribdl/const.py.

You should then be able to automatically download full version of both textual books and audiobooks
from Scribd using the tool by running the commands as usual.
